## What is this thing?

It's the source code for my blog!

## Why does your blog exist?

Simple answer: shameless self-promotion.  I think my ideas and opinions are pretty good.  Hopefully you do too.

## It looks really professional, how'd you do it?

It was easy!  I just used the following tools:

1. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a framework.

2. ...and I used ["The Plain"](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) as the theme.

## What do I need to get this running locally for development?

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. [Ruby >= 2.0.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

3. Step 2:5 of [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-2-install-jekyll-using-bundler).

Get it running with [step 4](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-4-build-your-local-jekyll-site).
