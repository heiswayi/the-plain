## What is this thing?

It's the source code for my blog!

## Why does your blog exist?

Simple answer: shameless self-promotion.  I think my ideas and opinions are pretty good.  Hopefully you do too.

## It looks really professional, how'd you do it?

It was easy!  I just used the following tools:

1. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a framework.

2. ...and I used ["The Plain"](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) as the theme.
