Greetings. Salutations.

My name is Seth Kingry and I like to do stuff. I'm a systems engineer by trade so most of the stuff I do and how I do it has a technical/engineering slant to it. Some of the stuff I like to do: home automation, networking, computer security, organizing random piles of assorted objects. This blog is a chronical of some of the times I did stuff. Sometimes doing this stuff goes well, sometimes it doesn't, hopefully you enjoy reading about it either way.

If you're a recruiter that stumbled across this blog and think I might be a good fit for a position you're trying to fill, take a look at the post I have about my [resume](https://skingry.github.io/notes/my-resume).
