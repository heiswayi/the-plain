Hi!

My name is Bruno and I'm a Computer Science student at FCUP, Portugal. Whenever
I am not programming you can find me reading a book, watching some anime/movie
or playing online competitive games. I dream to travel and experience living in
Japan.

This is my personal blog and it is opened to whatever I feel writing about, hope
you enjoy it! Below are some resources that may be util.
