Greetings. Salutations. My name is Seth Kingry and I like to do stuff.

I'm a systems engineer by trade, so most of that stuff has a technical or engineering slant to it.

Examples of some of the stuff I like to do:

* Home Automation

* Networking

* Computer Security

* Organizing random piles of assorted objects.

This blog is a chronical of some of the times I did stuff. Sometimes doing that stuff went well, sometimes it didn't, hopefully you enjoy reading about it either way.

If you're a recruiter that stumbled across this blog and think I might be a good fit for a position you're trying to fill, take a look at the post I have about my [resume](https://skingry.github.io/notes/my-resume).
