How could I miss the oportunity to use this title for my first blog post,
right?! Here you go, a "Hello, World!" in my favourite programming language:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

I hope to share with you, the reader, much more code snippets and other
interesting stuff in the future posts.
